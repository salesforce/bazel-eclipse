## Bazel Eclipse Feature

This is the logical container of all the plugins related to the Bazel integration with Eclipse.
In Eclipse, such a container is known as a *feature*.
See the [architecture document](../../docs/dev/architecture.md) for more information about features.

### Static Files

This packages contains a number of static files that are used by the Eclipse SDK to manage the feature.

- [feature.xml](feature.xml)
- [build.properties](build.properties)

As you develop the Bazel Eclipse Feature, you may need to update these files.
Make sure to commit them back to the Git repo.
