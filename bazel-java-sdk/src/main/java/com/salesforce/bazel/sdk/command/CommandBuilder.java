/**
 * A base builder class to generate a Bazel Command object. This is a low level API
 * and typically there are convenience methods in BazelWorkspaceCommandRunner that
 * will create the commands for you.
 * <p>
 * Specific implementations include the ShellCommandBuilder (which creates actual shell invocations) 
 * and the MockCommandBuilder (for running functional tests that simulate shell invocations).
 * <p>
 * As currently implemented, this class is not thread-safe. Meaning a single builder is stateful and
 * can only build one command object at a time. Invoking build() clears the state and makes the builder
 * ready for the next command to build.
