### Origins

This project began as a Salesforce private fork of the [Google Bazel Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/eclipse) aka e4b,
  which had been abandoned.
The last commit taken from that repo was *dc387fa035edca898fc5ffc80519f79f6d2d4f78* from April 2018.
The plugin (now evolved into a *feature* consisting of a set of plugins) has been heavily modified since the original fork.

### Attribution

  identified *The Bazel Authors* as Google Inc.
