## Releasing Bazel Eclipse

This document is for maintainers.
This is the set of steps for releasing a new version of BEF.

## Release Process (BEF and BJLS)

### Setting the Version

We follow SemVer.
Determine what type of release this must be (major, minor, patch) given the changes
  that are in master.
That will dictate what version number to use for the new release.

The version is set in a number of files, both for Maven and for OSGi (Eclipse).
For Maven pom.xml files, keep the *SNAPSHOT* suffix (e.g. *1.3.1-SNAPSHOT*).
For OSGi meta files, keep the *qualifier* suffix (e.g. *1.3.1.qualifier*).

Tycho has commands for this, and is a good start, but they don't do the full job so you will need to iterate:
```
 # clean first, so when you grep through files you dont get built artfiacts
 mvn clean

 # auto update the version
 mvn -X -DnewVersion=1.3.1-SNAPSHOT tycho-versions:set-version

 # find any files it missed (manually update these)
 find . -type f | xargs grep '1.3.0-SNAPSHOT'

 # now tell tycho to finish updating the metadata
 mvn -X tycho-versions:update-eclipse-metadata

 # rebuild with the new versions
 mvn clean verify

 # after the build, do a sweep for the old version to see if anything was missed, iterate if so
 find . -type f | xargs grep 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT
```

In the end, you will need to manually ensure the new version is applied everywhere.
This [PR for version 1.3.1](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/pull/225/files)
  gives you an idea.


### Local Build and Testing (BEF)

Prior to releasing BEF, please test it from a fresh install of standard Eclipse (not an SDK version).
Launching BEF (as inner eclipse) from the Eclipse SDK (outer eclipse) is not a sufficient test.
Certain packaging problems will not appear when launched from Eclipse SDK.
Instead, please download the latest JEE Eclipse to test with.

The build will write the built feature into the _releng/p2repository/target/_ directory.
You can install from the archive zip in that location.
Use the standard Eclipse _Help -> Install New Software..._ menu and choose to _Add_ an _Archive_.

:fire: Due to a bug in Eclipse SDK, the _Export->Deployable Features_ approach to generating
an update site from within the SDK IDE does NOT work. It mistakenly thinks that the
_bazel-java-sdk_ plugin depends on the _bazel-java-sdk-tests_ plugin, which results in
a circular dependency. This appears to be a bug in the SDK dependency resolution system.

Make sure to run through an import of a decently complex Bazel workspace.
Things to look for:
- The Bazel Classpath is correct for each project
- There are no build errors in the Problems View
- Open a .java file in an editor an make sure there aren't any red squigglies

### Local Build and Testing (BJLS)

Steps to be determined.

### Releasing from GitHub to the Update Site (BEF)

Note that we have two update sites for *each* product, one for the official releases and one for release candidates.
Deploy a release candidate and test it prior to releasing the official release.

BEF Links:
- [Update Instructions](https://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/) are written [here](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/blob/master/.github/bef-update-site-index.html)
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
- Official release update site: https://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/update-site
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
- Release candidate (RC) update site: http://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/update-site-release-candidate

:fire: The update site is our live installation location for our users. If you are doing
experimental work with the release process, please do not release directly to _gh-pages_
branch.

- Issue a release candidate prior to deploying an official release
- Update the _github-pages-deploy-action_ stage in
[the workflow](../../.github/workflows/bef-build-release-deploy.yml) to deploy to a test
branch if you have **any** doubts about what you are releasing.
- Be prepared to rollback the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/tree/gh-pages)
at the first sign of trouble (see steps on how to do this in next section).

Our GitHub repo has our release process implemented as a GitHub Actions workflow.
To build the release, make sure you have your versions set and committed to master (see above).

Then, run the release workflow:
 - Navigate to the [Bazel Eclipse Actions](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/actions) tab in GitHub
 - Click on the _BEF Release_ or _BEF Release Test Candidate_ button in the left nav
 - Click on the _Run Workflow_ button on the right side, and pick the branch to release from (normally _master_)
 - Monitor the build, it should take about a minute
 - Navigate to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/tree/gh-pages) of the repo. It contains all the files from the release.
   - Verify the files look to be correct (i.e. check version in the filenames)

### Test the Update Site (BEF)

First, check that our landing page is available and has correct instructions:

- [BEF Update Site landing page](https://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/)

Next, follow the instructions on the page and install BEF into a fresh copy of Eclipse.
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
If you are testing a release candidate, remember to use the RC update site http://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/update-site-release-candidate.
Finally, repeat the install test with the zip file that is in the root directory of the *gh-pages* branch

If anything fails, revert the changes in the _gh-pages_ branch ASAP!
It is the live update site for all of our users.

```
# assume release 1.3.2 has a problem, revert gh-pages back to 1.3.1
git checkout gh-pages
git reset --hard 1.3.1.updatesite
git push --force origin gh-pages
```

### Creating the Official Release Record

After the release build has been confirmed, please create a new release in our
  [Releases](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/releases) list.
Click the _Draft a new release_ button to get started.
You will attach the zip archive of the release, which was built by the GitHub Action and
  add to [this location in the gh-pages branch](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/tree/gh-pages/update-site/features).

Please follow the pattern of previous releases.
Be sure to list the changes and give credit to outside contributors.
Especially look at the naming convention of the archive file, as in _bazel-eclipse-feature-1.3.1-release.zip_.

As part of the release, you will create a tag.
Follow our convention of using the bare SemVer, like _1.3.1_.

### Tag the Update Site

In the previous step, you tagged the _master_ branch as a side effect of creating the release record.
We also want to tag the update site, as we may need to rollback if the next release fails.
This is done by tagging the _gh-pages_ branch.

```
git checkout gh-pages
git pull
git tag 1.3.1.updatesite
git push origin 1.3.1.updatesite
```

### Update the Version in pom.xml

Ideally, you will now set the version in the metadata to be the next expected version.
This is good because it is easy to forget the *Setting the Version* steps when
  triggering the RC workflow for the next release.
Doing it now will prevent mistakes later.

### Update the Eclipse Marketplace Record (BEF)

For each release, we need to add an entry to our Marketplace record.
The BEF record is here, which will have an _Edit_ button if you are entitled:

- [BEF in the Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/bazel-eclipse-feature)

When you create a new _Solution Version_, use these data points:
- Version: use the full version like *1.4.0.v20210707-0040* (get this from the [gh-pages release filename](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/tree/gh-pages/update-site/features) )
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
- Update site: https://opensource.salesforce.com/bazel-eclipse/update-site
- Feature id: *com.salesforce.bazel.eclipse.feature*

Make sure to remove the previous _Solution Version_ entry, so that the Marketplace will
  offer the newer version metadata.

## GitHub Actions Release Implementation (BEF)

The release workflow is defined using GitHub Actions.
Instead of explaining how it works, here are some pointers to some interesting files:

- [Release workflow definition](../../.github/workflows/bef-build-release-deploy.yml)
- [Update site layout script](../../.github/bef-create-update-site.sh)
- [Update site layout script for RCs](../../.github/bef-create-update-site-rc.sh)
