## Conforming Java Packages

In various places in our Bazel Eclipse Feature documentation, we reference the term **Conforming Java Packages**.
This page defines that term.

### Link to the Bazel Java SDK

Under the covers BEF uses the separately managed [Bazel Java SDK](../dev/bazeljavasdk.md) for all interactions with Bazel.
For more information about conforming Java packages, please see the documentation in the SDK:

- [Conforming Java Packages (SDK)](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-java-sdk/blob/master/conforming_java_packages.md)
