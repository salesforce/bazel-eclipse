## GFlags

This is a static copy of the Google [gflags python utility](https://github.com/gflags/gflags).
It is used by some of the build steps.

It was copied into this project (i.e. vendor'd) because it is a small library and we don't need to stay
  on the latest version.
The alternate is to use a remote repository, but this feels easier.
