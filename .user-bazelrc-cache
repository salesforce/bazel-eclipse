# **********************************
# CACHING
# **********************************

#
# This caching configuration is maintained as a separate bazelrc file for several reasons:
#
# 1. Depending on network speed (in an office, at home, on a beach) a user may or may not
#    benefit from using the remote cache. Having cache configuration declared in this
#    .user-bazelrc-cache file (which is .gitignored) allows each user decide whether or not
#    to use remote cache.
# 2. Only CI nodes are authorized to populate the cache. Currently, the only way to
#    allow CI nodes to authenticate with Bazel cache is to pass the username/password via
#    HTTP Basic, which means the URL below needs to be configured with the username/password.
#    We don't want that in plaintext, so our CI overwrites this file dynamically with the
#    securely stored credentials. Having cache settings as a dedicated file makes that easy.


# Local Disk Cache (use if your network speed is slow)
#  Enable the local disk cache by default
build --disk_cache=/tmp/bazelcache/bazel-eclipse
build --remote_upload_local_results=true

# Remote Build Cache
#  Use if you are on a fast network

# Read-only remote cache configuration
#  Dev machines do not upload new cache entries.
#build --remote_http_cache=https://your_remote_cache_host.yourcompany.com:443/cache
#build --remote_upload_local_results=false

# Read-write remote cache configuration
#  Only CI has the ACL to populate cache.
#  Replace the username and password variables with the actuals in the URL below.
#build --remote_http_cache=https://USER:PWD@your_remote_cache_host.yourcompany.com:443/cache
#build --remote_upload_local_results=true
