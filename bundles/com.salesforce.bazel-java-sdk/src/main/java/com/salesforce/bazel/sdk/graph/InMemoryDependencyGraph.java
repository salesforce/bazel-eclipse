/**
 * The Bazel dependency graph of the entire workspace. This is implemented using simple Java JDK primitives rather than
 * bring in a new graph dependency for the purpose. It is a directed acyclic graph with multiple root/starting nodes. It
 * is too simplistic to view the workspace as a single tree of dependencies. It is actually a set of trees that probably
 * overlap. All we know is that it is a directed graph, and will not have cycles.
 * <p>
 * This class is oriented around use cases where you need to traverse the graph in these ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>starting with all the root nodes
 * <li>starting with all the leaf nodes
 * <li>random access lookup of graph information with the package label
 * <p>
 * Terminology:
 * <p>
 * Source -> Dep: if A depends on B
 * <ul>
 * <li>Source/Dep: if A depends on B, A is the source, B is a dep
 * <li>Root nodes: labels that are not a dep of any other label in the workspace.
 * <li>Leaf nodes: labels that are not a root, and have no deps. They may have external dependencies (e.g. Maven sourced
 * jars).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>CAVEAT</b> this dependency graph has a granularity of labels, not targets. What this means is if //a/b/c:foo
 * depends on //a/d/e:bar, this graph will track the dependency as //a/b/c => //a/d/e. This is sufficient for most
 * cases, but there are some cases that can't be modeled. If //a/b/c:foo depends on //a/d/e:bar which depends on
 * //a/b/c:fooz, this graph will fail to model it because foo => bar => fooz would be seen as a cyclic dependency.
