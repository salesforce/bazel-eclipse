/**
 * An index of JVM types. This is the output of an indexer that knows how to traverse the file system looking for JVM
 * types. This is useful for tools that need to have a full list of available JVM types. For example, a Bazel IDE will
 * want to be able to list all types imported by the workspace.
 * <p>
 * There are three parts to the index: the artifactDictionary, fileDictionary and the typeDictionary.
 * <p>
 * The artifactDictionary maps the Maven style artifactId (e.g. junit, hamcrest-core, slf4j-api) to the one or more jar
 * files found that contains that artifactId. If your directories contains multiple versions of the same artifactId,
 * this will be a list of artifacts.
 * <p>
 * The fileDictionary maps the filename (e.g. junit-4.12.jar) to the one or more locations where that filename was
 * found.
 * <p>
 * The typeDictionary maps each found classname to the discovered location in jar files or raw source files.
 * <p>
 * This is intentionally a lighter indexing system than provided by the MavenIndexer project, which generates full
 * Lucene indexes of code. We found the performance of that indexing solution to be too slow for our needs.
