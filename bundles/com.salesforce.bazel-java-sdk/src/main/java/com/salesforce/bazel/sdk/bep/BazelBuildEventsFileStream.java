 * /** Bazel build event protocol stream (BEP) for a Bazel workspace. This implementation reads a file, publishes the
 * events in the file to the subscriber(s), and ends the stream.
 * <p>
 * Because this stream integrates with your builds with Bazel using BEP, this stream will work with command line builds
 * but also with IDE builds.
 * <p>
 * After creation, you must start the stream by calling activateStream().
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This feature requires you to provide BEP JSON file(s). These can be generated with a configuration
 * change to your Bazel workspace: you must add the following lines to your .bazelrc file to enable BEP:<br/>
 * build --build_event_json_file bep_build.json<br/>
 * test --build_event_json_file bep_test.json<br/>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, you must call addFileToMonitor() for each configured json file (bep_build.json and
 * bep_test.json).
