/**
 * Takes a project relative path to a Java source file (source/java/com/salesforce/foo/Foo.java), and splits the path
 * into two parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>source/java</li>
 * <li>com/salesforce/foo/Foo.java</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To do this the splitter must parse the .java file to see the "package com.salesforce.foo;" statement which makes this
 * operation a bit expensive.
 * <p>
 * There is an anti-pattern of not using the package hierarchy in the path to the source files (e.g.
 * source/java/Foo.java) which is supported by Bazel and other build systems but is definitely not what people should be
 * doing. This anti-pattern is supported by this splitter when detected by returning the whole path, minus the file, as
 * the SplitSourcePath.sourceDirectoryPath. This may work with some tools (Bazel, for example, is ok with this), but
 * other tools (e.g. Eclipse) will flag this use case as an error.
