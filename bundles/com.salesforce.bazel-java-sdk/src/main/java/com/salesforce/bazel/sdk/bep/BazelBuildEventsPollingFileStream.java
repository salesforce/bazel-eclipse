/**
 * Bazel build event protocol stream (BEP) for a Bazel workspace. A BEP stream allows you to monitor and react to build
 * events emitted from Bazel. This implementation spawns a thread and actively polls one or more BEP files for new
 * events. It is intelligent and will only reparse a file if the file modification time has changed.
 * <p>
 * Because this stream integrates with your builds with Bazel using BEP, this stream will work with command line builds
 * but also with IDE builds.
 * <p>
 * After creation, you must start the stream by calling activateStream().
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This feature requires a configuration change to your Bazel workspace: you must add the following lines
 * to your .bazelrc file to enable BEP:<br/>
 * build --build_event_json_file bep_build.json<br/>
 * test --build_event_json_file bep_test.json<br/>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, you must call addFileToMonitor() for each configured json file (bep_build.json and
 * bep_test.json).
