/**
 * An index of types. This is the output of an indexer that knows how to traverse the file system looking for types for
 * a specific language (e.g. Java). This is useful for tools that need to have a full list of available types. For
 * example, a Bazel IDE will want to be able to list all types imported by the workspace.
 * <p>
 * There are three parts to the index: the artifactDictionary, fileDictionary and the typeDictionary.
 * <p>
 * The artifactDictionary maps the artifactId (e.g. junit, hamcrest-core, slf4j-api) to the one or more archives found
 * that contains that artifactId. If your directories contains multiple versions of the same artifactId, this will be a
 * list of artifacts.
 * <p>
 * The fileDictionary maps the filename (e.g. junit-4.12.jar) to the one or more locations where that filename was
 * found.
 * <p>
 * The typeDictionary maps each found type name (e.g. the fully qualified Java classname) to the discovered location in
 * archive files or raw source files.
