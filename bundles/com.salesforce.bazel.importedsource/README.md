# Imported Source

This project contains source code imported from Bazel and Bazel Intellij Plug-in.
Both project don't publish re-usable libraries.
Therefore, we import the things we need manually.

## Important Settings

This project does not follow the BEF project settings.
Because the code is imported we do not want it to be processed (eg., formatted).
