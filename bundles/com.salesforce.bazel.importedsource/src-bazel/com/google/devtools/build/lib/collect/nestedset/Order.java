/**
 * Type of a nested set (defines order).
 *
 * <p>
 * STABLE_ORDER: an unspecified traversal order. Use when the order of elements does not matter. In Starlark it is
 * called "default"; its older deprecated name is "stable".
 *
 * <p>
 * COMPILE_ORDER: left-to-right postorder. In Starlark it is called "postorder"; its older deprecated name is "compile".
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, for the nested set {B, D, {A, C}}, the iteration order is "A C B D" (child-first).
 *
 * <p>
 * This type of set would typically be used for artifacts where elements of nested sets go before the direct members of
 * a set, for example in the case of Javascript dependencies.
 *
 * <p>
 * LINK_ORDER: a variation of left-to-right preorder that enforces topological sorting. In Starlark it is called
 * "topological"; its older deprecated name is "link".
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, for the nested set {A, C, {B, D}}, the iteration order is "A C B D" (parent-first).
 *
 * <p>
 * This type of set would typically be used for artifacts where elements of nested sets go after the direct members of a
 * set, for example when providing a list of libraries to the C++ compiler.
 *
 * <p>
 * The custom ordering has the property that elements of nested sets always come before elements of descendant nested
 * sets. Left-to-right order is preserved if possible, both for items and for references to nested sets.
 *
 * <p>
 * The left-to-right pre-order-like ordering is implemented by running a right-to-left postorder traversal and then
 * reversing the result.
 *
 * <p>
 * The reason naive left-to left-to-right preordering is not used here is that it does not handle diamond-like
 * structures properly. For example, take the following structure (nesting downwards):
 *
 * <pre>
 *    A
 *   / \
 *  B   C
 *   \ /
 *    D
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Naive preordering would produce "A B D C", which does not preserve the "parent before child" property: C is a parent
 * of D, so C should come before D. Either "A B C D" or "A C B D" would be acceptable. This implementation returns the
 * first option of the two so that left-to-right order is preserved.
 *
 * <p>
 * In case the nested sets form a tree, the ordering algorithm is equivalent to standard left-to-right preorder.
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes it may not be possible to preserve left-to-right order:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      A
 *    /   \
 *   B     C
 *  / \   / \
 *  \   E   /
 *   \     /
 *    \   /
 *      D
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The left branch (B) would indicate "D E" ordering and the right branch (C) dictates "E D". In such cases ordering is
 * decided by the rightmost branch because of the list reversing behind the scenes, so the ordering in the final
 * enumeration will be "E D".
 *
 * <p>
 * NAIVE_LINK_ORDER: a left-to-right preordering. In Starlark it is called "preorder"; its older deprecated name is
 * "naive_link".
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, for the nested set {B, D, {A, C}}, the iteration order is "B D A C".
 *
 * <p>
 * The order is called naive because it does no special treatment of dependency graphs that are not trees. For such
 * graphs the property of parent-before-dependencies in the iteration order will not be upheld. For example, the
 * diamond-shape graph A->{B, C}, B->{D}, C->{D} will be enumerated as "A B D C" rather than "A B C D" or "A C B D".
 *
 * <p>
 * The difference from LINK_ORDER is that this order gives priority to left-to-right order over
 * dependencies-after-parent ordering. Note that the latter is usually more important, so please use LINK_ORDER whenever
 * possible.
