/**
 * Bazel generally requires BUILD file authors to list all dependencies explicitly. However, there are a few legacy
 * cases in which dependencies are implied. For example, java_test implicitly brings in junit, hamcrest,
 * javax.annotation libraries.
 * <p>
 * This is unfortunate because external tools that need to construct the dependency graph (ahem, that's us, for JDT) we
 * need to know to append the implicit dependencies to the explicit ones identified by the Aspect.
 * <p>
 * This is a helper class for computing implicit dependencies. See https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/issues/43
 * for details and design considerations for this class. $SLASH_OK url
 * <p>
 * This code is isolated from the classpath container code because this is somewhat of a hack and it is nice to have it
 * isolated.
