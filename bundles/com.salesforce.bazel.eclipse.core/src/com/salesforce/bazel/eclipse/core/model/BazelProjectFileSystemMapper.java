/**
 * A mapper for virtual {@link BazelProject Bazel projects} from the Eclipse workspace into the actual file system.
 * <p>
 * As described in {@link BazelProject} the Bazel Eclipse Feature is very opinionated about how projects will be created
 * for Bazel workspaces. This mapper helps with projects representing targets. Those projects cannot be created directly
 * within the folder of ther package due to potential conflicts. Instead we create all those projects in a dedicated
 * project area and use links/virtual resource in Eclipse to point to the actual resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are a few constraints when using virtual resources especially with regards to source control
 * plug-ins/extension. This mapper tries to address some of them. For example, by placing the project area within a
 * <code>.eclipse/projects</code> folder insider the Bazel workspace it should be possible to share/version those
 * project definitions. However, this is a design assumption which needs to be verified and revisited once we have more
 * experience at scale.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note, callers of this class must ensure their usage allows the return value of any location in this class to
 * change/evolve over time. This specifically means that locations should only be used/queried at creation/provisioning
 * time of projects. It should not be used for computing locations and discovery during day to day use. Instead other
 * means of the Bazel model must be used.
 * </p>
