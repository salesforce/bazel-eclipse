# Bazel Eclipse Feature (BEF) ![BEF Logo](docs/logos/bef_logo_small.png)

This is the Eclipse Feature for developing [Bazel](http://bazel.io) projects in Eclipse.
The Bazel Eclipse Feature supports importing, building, and testing Java projects that are built using the Bazel build system.

This project is supported by Salesforce.

## BEF Status and Roadmap

Development of this feature is currently being done as a side project by a team within Salesforce.
You can track our past/current/future work using these links:

- [BEF project management](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/projects)

Current development is dedicated to Bazel workspaces with Java rules.
The **1.x** release line is focused on:
- Basic features of Java editing (code completion, incremental compilation, launching programs, debugging, etc)
- Correctness of the Bazel-derived classpath
- Scalability and performance
- Gradually reducing [certain package file layout restrictions](docs/conforming_java_packages.md).

The **2.x** release line will work towards adding Bazel specific features to Eclipse:
- BUILD file editor
- Automatic dependency management
- Support for more complex Java package layouts

Support for languages other than Java will likely not appear prior to 3.x.
