# Bazel Eclipse Feature (BEF) and Bazel Java Language Server (BJLS)

This Git repository contains two [Bazel](http://bazel.io) IDE projects.
They share a large amount of code and therefore live together here.
Both provide IDE integrations for projects built by the [Bazel](http://bazel.io) build system.

:octocat: Please do us a huge favor. If you think these projects could be useful for you, now or in the future, please hit the **Star** button at the top. That helps us advocate for more resources on this project. Thanks!

These projects are supported by Salesforce.

### BEF: Bazel Eclipse Feature ![BEF Logo](docs/logos/bef_logo_small.png)

This is the Eclipse Feature for developing [Bazel](http://bazel.io) projects in Eclipse.
The Bazel Eclipse Feature supports importing, building, and testing Java projects that are built using the Bazel build system.

Full documentation is available here:
- [Bazel Eclipse Feature docs](docs/bef/README.md)

### BJLS: Bazel Java Language Server ![BEF Logo](docs/logos/bjls_logo_small.jpeg)

This is a [Language Server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implementation for Java projects built by Bazel.
This enables IDEs such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to be used to develop the project.

Full documentation is available here:
