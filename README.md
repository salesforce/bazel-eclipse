# Bazel Eclipse Feature

This is the Eclipse Feature for developing [Bazel](http://bazel.io) projects in Eclipse.
The Bazel Eclipse Feature supports importing, building, and testing Java projects that are built using the Bazel build system.

This project is supported by Salesforce.

## Feature Status and Roadmap

Active development of this feature is currently being done by a team within Salesforce.
You can track our past/current/future work using these links:

- [bazel-eclipse roadmap](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/wiki)
- [bazel-eclipse issues](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-eclipse/issues)

:fire: currently the feature is still in development and only works on small, Java-only workspaces. There are known scalability issues, and current development is only focused on Java projects.
