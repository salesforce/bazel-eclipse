# Bazel Eclipse Feature (BEF)

This is the Eclipse Feature for developing [Bazel](http://bazel.io) projects in Eclipse.
The Bazel Eclipse Feature supports importing, building, and testing Java projects that are built using the Bazel build system.

This project is supported by Salesforce.

:fire: currently the feature is still in development. There are known scalability issues, and current development is focused on Java projects that follow [certain file layout conventions](docs/conforming_java_packages.md).
